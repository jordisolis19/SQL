# SQL Portfolio - By Jordi Solis

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio!

I'm Jordi Solis, a Business Operations professional transitioning into Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. Here, you'll find a curated collection of my SQL projects that reflect my journey in mastering data manipulation, analysis, and storytelling.

This portfolio is arranged to showcase my growth: starting with my most  advanced work (like the Music Database Analysis) and moving toward my foundational projects. Each piece demonstrates my evolving ability to transform complex data into actionable insights—whether it's optimizing sales strategies, identifying trends, or solving business problems.

I'm constantly expanding my SQL toolkit and have recently completed a TripleTen Certification in Business inteligence. I will be working on adding my newest projects here and I would love to connect if you have feedback, collaboration ideas, or just want to talk data!

Explore the projects below to see how I've progressed from writing basic queries to tackling multi-table joins, subqueries, and performance optimization. And stay tuned—I'm always adding more as I learn.
