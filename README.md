# SQL Portfolio - By Jordi Solis

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio.

You can use the links below to review SQL projects I've created. This list is arranged with the most recent projects at the top (showcasing my current skill level) and then moving on to older projects to show my progression. Please reach out with any questions. I would be happy to discuss my qualifications and skills.
